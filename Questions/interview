Sanity Testing (Basic Check Before Opening the Restaurant)

🔍 Quick test to see if key things work before deep testing
Example: Check if the restaurant has a door, lights, and a kitchen before opening.
Mobile Example: Ensure the phone boots up, touchscreen works, and network connects after flashing a new build.
If it fails, stop testing! 🚫
Smoke Testing (Checking All Main Features Before Serving Customers)

🔍 A high-level check to see if major functions work
Example: Check if the restaurant has tables, a working stove, and waiters before serving food.
Mobile Example: Verify that major features like calls, Wi-Fi, camera, messaging, and UI navigation work.
Regression Testing (Ensuring Old Features Still Work After a Change)

🔍 Deep testing to ensure new updates haven’t broken old functionalities
Example: After changing the menu, ensure old dishes still taste good and the restaurant functions as before.
Mobile Example: After a modem update, check that network stability, battery life, and touchscreen responsiveness remain unchanged.
📌 How to Explain in the Interview (1-Minute Answer) 🎯
"In Qualcomm mobile testing, we perform:

Sanity Testing to ensure that a new build boots up and basic functionalities work.
Smoke Testing to verify that major features like calls, Wi-Fi, and UI interactions function properly.
Regression Testing to check that old functionalities haven’t broken after an update.
If a sanity test fails, we stop testing immediately. If a smoke test fails, we reject the build. Regression testing ensures the system remains stable after updates. We use ADB logs, Logcat, automation frameworks, and Monkey Testing to validate these."

📌 Super-Easy Mnemonic Trick: "SSR" (Sanity → Smoke → Regression) 🔥
👉 Sanity → Smoke → Regression
👉 Small Check → System Check → Retesting After Update

🔥 Remember:

Sanity = Small check (Basic functions) 🔍
Smoke = System check (Major features) 📱
Regression = Retest after updates (Everything still works) 🔄
